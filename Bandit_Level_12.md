# OverTheWire Bandit Level 12 Walkthrough

---
## **Previous Level:** Level 11

**Login:**

**SSH:** `ssh bandit12@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`

**Password:** `7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4`


## **Overview**  
This report documents the solution and key learnings for **OverTheWire Bandit Level 11 â†’ 12**, focusing on decoding a ROT13-encoded file using the `tr` command to perform character substitution.

---

## **Problem Statement**
The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt**, where all lowercase `(a-z)` and uppercase `(A-Z)` letters have been rotated by 13 positions.
**Substitution** means replacing one character with another. Substitution ciphers have been known and used for a very long time. Some of the most known are the Caesar and VigenÃ¨re ciphers. However, these simple substitution ciphers are not secure anymore!

As the â€˜Helpful Reading Materialâ€™ on the levels site mentions, rotating letters by 13 positions is the **ROT13** substitution cipher. It is nice because looking at the Latin alphabet with 26 letters the encryption algorithm equals the decryption algorithm.

The Linux `tr` command, which stands for â€™translateâ€™, allows replacing characters with others. The base command syntax looks like the following `tr <old_chars> <new_chars>`.

### **Task**:
- Decode the ROT13-encoded password in `data.txt`.
  - **Server**: `bandit.labs.overthewire.org`  
  - **Port**: `2220`  
  - **Username**: `bandit12`  
  - **Password**: `7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4`


### **Challenge**:  
- All alphabetic characters in `data.txt` are rotated by 13 positions (ROT13 cipher).
---

## ðŸš€**Solution Approach**
Use the `tr` command to map characters using ROT13 substitution:  
- **ROT13**: Replace each letter with the one 13 positions ahead in the alphabet (wrapping around).  
- `A-Z` becomes `N-ZA-M`, `a-z` becomes `n-za-m`.
---


### **Code Example**  
```bash
# Connect to the server
ssh bandit11@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

### **Output**
```bash
bandit11@bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password: [hidden input]
Welcome to OverTheWire!
```

###  Decode ROT13 using tr
```bash
bandit11@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
The password is 7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4
```

So we got the next passwordðŸŽ‰.

## Key Takeaways

- **ROT13 Cipher:**
  - A substitution cipher where each letter is shifted by 13 positions.
  - **Self-inverse:** Encoding and decoding use the same algorithm (e.g., `tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'`).

- **`tr` Command:**
  - Translates or deletes characters (e.g., `tr <old_chars> <new_chars>`).

- **Alias Tip:**
  - Create shortcuts for common ciphers:
```bash
alias rot13="tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'"  # ROT13 for letters
alias rot5="tr '0-9' '5-90-4'"             # ROT5 for numbers
 ```

 ## Additional Notes
 - **Alternative Methods:**
   - Use online ROT13 decoders (e.g., rot13.com).
   - Decode with Python:

```python
python3 -c "import codecs; print(codecs.decode('Gur cnffjbeq vf 5Gr8L4qetPEsPk8htqjhRK8XSP6x2RHh', 'rot_13'))"
```
- **Troubleshooting:**
  - Ensure case sensitivity: `A-Za-z` covers uppercase and lowercase.
  - Verify no typos in the `tr` substitution pattern.
